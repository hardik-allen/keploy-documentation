# Getting Started with Keploy for Go: A Developer's Guide

So you've heard about Keploy and want to see what all the fuss is about? You're in the right place. This tutorial will walk you through setting up Keploy with a Go application, but more importantly, we'll explore **why** each step matters and what Keploy is actually doing under the hood.

<h2 id="what-is-keploy">What is Keploy, and Why Should You Care?</h2>

Before we dive into the setup, let's understand what Keploy brings to the table. As a Go developer, you're probably familiar with the pain of writing and maintaining integration tests. You mock dependencies, set up test databases, write assertions, and then maintain all of that code as your application evolves.

Keploy flips this script. Instead of you writing tests, Keploy **records** real API calls and their responses, then **replays** them as tests. Think of it as having a test suite that writes itself based on how your application actually behaves.

**The Big Idea**: Keploy intercepts HTTP traffic between your application and external services (databases, APIs, etc.), records the interactions, and uses them to generate test cases. This means your tests reflect real-world usage patterns, not hypothetical scenarios.

Before we start, make sure you have:

- **Go 1.19+** installed (check with `go version`)
- **Docker** installed and running (Keploy uses it for dependency management)
- A basic understanding of Go web frameworks (we'll use Gin as an example, but the concepts apply to Echo, Fiber, etc.)
